[AI_OFM_Strategy] AI OFM Basic Strategy Overview This document outlines the step-by-step workflow for launching and scaling an AI-powered OnlyFans Management (OFM) pipeline. The goal is to set up an AI model, generate marketable content, and begin monetization through Fanvue and social platforms. Acquire a Dataset for Lora Training - Collect a high-quality dataset of reference images for your model. - Ensure dataset consistency (angles, lighting, poses) to train an identifiable look. - Use ethical sourcing — avoid copyrighted or stolen materials. Train Loras on Tensor.art - Train Flux and SDXL LoRA models using the dataset. - Optimize parameters for realism and brand consistency. - Save the trained LoRAs for deployment. Download ComfyUI Workflows - Access ComfyUI workflows from the group’s shared resources. - Use prebuilt workflows for portrait, lifestyle, and NSFW content. - Customize nodes as needed for your creator brand. Deploy ComfyUI on Runpod - Launch a GPU instance on Runpod. - Deploy ComfyUI with your trained LoRA models. - Generate high-resolution image batches for content scheduling. Launch a Fanvue Account - Create a Fanvue creator profile. - Upload your first set of images. - Optimize bio, banner, and pricing tiers for engagement. Build Social Media Funnels - Create Instagram and TikTok accounts for your AI persona. - Post a mix of lifestyle, teaser, and promotional content. - Link all platforms back to your Fanvue profile. Begin Chatting With Fans - Once the first fans arrive, start chat-based monetization. - Use scripted upsells to push fans toward PPV content. - Segment fans into: - GFE fans (Girlfriend Experience, long chats, high LTV) - Content fans (transactional, fast buys) - Track whales and time wasters, adjusting strategy accordingly. End Goal: Build a sustainable, scalable AI creator funnel that drives new fans from social → Fanvue, while maximizing retention and sales through effective chatting.

[Fan Management Strategies GFE vs Sexual Fans] Knowledge Document: Fan Management Strategies (GFE vs Sexual Fans) Core Concept of Chatting Chatting is the foundation of monetization. Two main fan types exist, and their behaviors sometimes overlap: Girlfriend Experience (GFE) Fans – seek emotional connection, attention, and ongoing conversations. Sexual Fans – primarily interested in content and direct purchases. Fan Archetypes GFE Fans: Want to chat about life, hobbies, or personal issues. Require consistent emotional support. Potential to spend heavily (“whales”) if they feel valued. Sexual Fans: More transactional. Easier to convert with direct offers of content. Typically more numerous than GFE fans. Whales Whales are high-spending GFE fans. They respond strongly to emotional support, validation, and consistent attention. Building long-term relationships with whales is highly profitable. Time Wasters Found in both GFE and sexual fan categories. Engage in chatting without intent to purchase. Strategy to identify: Begin interactions with low-cost offers. Gradually increase pricing. Failure to purchase after several prompts = time waster. Business Strategy Team Building & Scaling Hire reliable chatters who can adapt to different fan types. Train staff to recognize whales, buyers, and time wasters. Structure the team for efficiency and consistency. Chatting Structure Implement scripts and processes for both fan types. Maintain boundaries and protect staff privacy. Regularly evaluate and adjust strategies. Selling to Sexual Fans More straightforward; focus on upselling content packages. Direct approach works best. Selling to GFE Fans More nuanced; requires patience, support, and consistent attention. Build deeper connections to unlock higher spending potential. Best Practices Always differentiate between fan types early. Apply different strategies: transactional vs emotional. Protect staff from overexposure or personal risks. Continuously maintain and update the chatting framework. Stay flexible — not every fan will fit neatly into GFE or sexual categories. ✅ Use this document to train assistants and chatters. ✅ Refer to it when creating scripts, structuring the team, or deciding how to prioritize fans.

[Chatting_Management_SOP] Complete Chatting & Management SOP 1. Core Principles of Chatting - Two Archetypes of Fans: - GFE (Girlfriend Experience) – Long-term, emotional attention buyers; whales emerge here. - Sexual Fans – Quick, transactional buyers focused on content. - Time Wasters – Anyone who talks but doesn’t buy. Test early (e.g., $20 PPV within 24h). If resistant → mark as time waster. - Whales – High-value fans; prioritize, isolate from mass blasts, and tailor content around their preferences. Industry Context - Customers are experienced and skeptical; most have subscribed to multiple models before. - Anything robotic, ESL, or revealing the use of agencies breaks immersion. - Aim for 60–70% natural language fluency as a baseline; improve progressively. Chatting Tactics a) Indirect Persuasion - Formula: Story → Problem → Need → Solution → Urgency. - Plant ideas weeks in advance so fans believe purchases are their idea. b) GFE vs Sexual Sales - Sexual Fans: escalate PPV bundles, fast-paced sales. - GFE Fans: slower buildup, emotional storytelling, indirect persuasion. - Price Scaling: start low, scale higher with intensity. c) Content Vault Management - Less is More (AI rule): - Only keep perfect, non-AI-revealing content. - Delete low-quality or flawed material. - Whales pay for connection, not for endless content. Traffic & Marketing - Traffic > Chatting Quality – Without enough subs, chatters go idle. - Aim: 20–30 free subs/day minimum. - At low traffic, owners should chat themselves to maximize conversions. Daily Chatter SOP - Every 30 Minutes: - Clear chats & poke fans. - If no reply → unsend last poke, re-poke. - New Fans: - Engage within 1 minute. - Use multiple openers until hooked. - Live Activity: - Maintain ≥3 active conversations. - Aggressively re-engage during low traffic. - Chat Analysis: - Review for TOS violations → unsend/report. - Update missing fan notes (name, age, job, kinks, budget, purchases). - Whale Monitoring: - Nurture top spenders daily. - Add 1–2 new whale prospects each shift. - Content QC: - Flag underpriced PPVs, poor sexting, no aftercare. - Activity Standard: - Minimum 85% activity, max 45 mins idle outside breaks. - Non-Compliance: Warnings → loss of shift → removal. Shift Leader Guidelines - Chat Clearing & Poking: Ensure chatters clear & poke every 30 mins. - Webcam Policy: Chatters must keep webcam on (no filters). Non-compliance = clock out + meeting required. - Punctuality: - 10-min grace for clocking in. - Pre-shift check-in: all present 10 mins early. - Fan Notes: Must be updated continuously; leaders enforce compliance. - Extensions: Only for valid fan cases; must be pre-approved. - Meetings: Weekly team meetings led by shift leaders. - Shift Reports: Detailed after every shift (issues, chatter performance, rule violations). - Low Activity / Attitude Issues: Correct once; if not fixed → clock out & send home. - Final Note: Strict enforcement = high standards; no exceptions. HR Daily SOP - Clock-In: - Record in Discord timesheet + #clock-in channel. - Start Hubstaff and keep running. - Job Posts (Telegram): - Post every 30 minutes in 10–15 groups. - Use automation if available. - Applicant Handling: - OLX: Reply, then move to WhatsApp. - Telegram: Reach out if they react but don’t message. - Important: Reject African/Kenyan applicants. - Initial Filter Questions: 1.
